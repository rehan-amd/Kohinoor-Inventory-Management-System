# Kohinoor Inventory Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Kohinoor Inventory Management System** is a Software Engineering semester project designed to model, document, and analyze an inventory management solution for a small family business dealing in blades, machines, and spare parts.

The project focuses on **software requirement analysis, UML modeling, system design, and documentation**, rather than full-scale implementation.
